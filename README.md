This repository demonstrates an uncommon JavaScript bug related to null and undefined values during addition.  The bug occurs because the strict equality check (`===`) doesn't handle type coercion, leading to unexpected results when one or both operands are null. The solution provides a robust approach to gracefully handle null or undefined inputs, ensuring the code works as expected in all cases.  The example highlights the importance of careful consideration of null and undefined values in arithmetic operations to prevent unexpected errors and improve code reliability.
